<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am currently a tenure-track associate professor in Software Engineering Institute of East China Normal University. Previously I worked at Nanyang Technological University as a research fellow. I received my PhD degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I was fortunate enough to be advised by Yong Yu and Zhihua Zhang. During the PhD, I visited the math department of UC Berkeley, hosted by Ming Gu. Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree from ACM Class at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.<br /></p>
<p><b>Prospective students:</b></p>
<p><font color=red>I am always looking for outstanding and highly self-motivated students to work with me. Please email me with your CV and transcripts if you are interested.</font></p>
<h2>Research Interest</h2>
<p>My research interest is in developing practical machine learning algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees, with a focus on</p>
<ul>
<li><p>online learning</p>
</li>
